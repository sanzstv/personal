          <p> I am a software engineer who excels at combining both the aesthetic and the functional aspects of web design.<br><br>

          I graduated from Santa Clara University in 2016 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science &amp; Engineering and a minor in Studio Art. Since then I have worked at an eCommerce startup where I supplemented my technical abilities with my design eye in order to create beautiful widgets for external clients and internal projects.<br><br>

          I absolutely love learning new skills and finding new ways to solve problems.<br><br>

          In my free time, you can usually find me at the gym or at a concert.</div>

            <h1>Experience (in progress :D)</h1>
            <h2><em>Deployment Specialist</em> - Reflektion</h2>
            <p>June 2016 – January 2017<br>
            Developed UI for product recommendations and search functionality for client websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JQuery. Worked with team to address issues on the client side as well as ours. Occasionally made UI mocks for clients (based off their existing sites or their own specifications) using Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
            <h2><em>Web Design Intern</em> - Organs R Us</h2>
            <p>June 2015 – November 2015<br>
            Worked with a group to first establish a wireframe for a general site structure, then applied prototype to develop functional website using a mixture of HTML, CSS, and PHP as well as some frameworks already in place. Also contributed to implementation of a registration feature using the PHP framework Yii and MySQL. Majority of the development was done independently by me.</p>

        <p>Here is a short sampling of some projects I've worked on.
        <h2>Music Share (in progress)</h2>
        <p>I listen to a ton of music. Rap, indie, punk, electronic, you name it. But how do I keep all of it together?</p>
        <h2>CSS Zen Garden (in progress)</h2>
        <p>Redesign of Zen Garden, which itself is a project based on showcasing the simple elegance of CSS based designs.</p>
        <h2>The New Grid</h2>
        <p>My 2016 Senior Design Project: The New Grid is a set of mobile libraries 
        that allowed Bluetooth data sharing 
        between users in a mesh network without 
        the need for underlying infrastructure. 
        The system included an Android app 
        that served as a proof-of-concept for 
        the effectiveness of our protocols. Read more about it <a href="http://scholarcommons.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1069&context=cseng_senior">here!</a></p>
        <h2>Reddit UI/UX Redesign</h2>
        <p>A (much needed) redesign I did of one of the internet's most popular websites. This redesign was crafted to avoid the pitfalls that befell Reddit's predecessor Digg after they overhauled their website. Emphasis on maintaining current site's emphasis on information density while also making much more aesthetically pleasing and functional. Just something I did for a class and unfortunately has not been implemented, but if anyone from Reddit has a change of heart and decides "yeah, my website is massively flawed, maybe we should do something about it", just let me know!</p>

        <h2>SCUWaitlister</h2>
        <p>A system to facilitate the waitlisting process at Santa Clara University which, as any Bronco is aware, was incredibly outdated.</p>
